Install Node.js and npm Vue.js requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). If you haven't already installed them, follow these steps:
Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

This will automatically install npm as well. You can verify the installation by running these commands in your terminal or command prompt:

node -v npm -v 2. Install Vue CLI (Optional but Recommended) The Vue CLI is a command-line tool that helps you scaffold new Vue projects quickly.

Open your terminal/command prompt and install the Vue CLI globally:

npm install -g @vue/cli Verify the installation by running:

vue --version 3. Create a New Vue Project You can create a new Vue project using the Vue CLI.

Run the following command to create a new project:

vue create my-vue-app You will be prompted to choose a preset (e.g., default or manually select features). You can go with the default for simplicity.

This will create a new folder my-vue-app and set up the necessary files.

Navigate to the Project Directory Once the project is created, navigate into your project directory:
cd my-vue-app 5. Start the Development Server Run the following command to start the development server:

npm run serve This will start a local development server, and you can view your Vue app by opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.
